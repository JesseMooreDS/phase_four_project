    "Our project aims to develop a recommendation system for a new streaming service, providing users with five personalized movie recommendations. The model that we developed uses both K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Alternating Least Squares modeling to create our recommendation system and to provide users with 5 recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Business and Data Understanding:\n",
    "We utilized the MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tags, making it well-suited for training a recommendation system. This dataset provides rich user-movie interactions and metadata, essential for building effective recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "For our modeling, the data required little / no cleaning or preparation aside from merging our ratings data with our movie data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries: \n",
    "Aside from the standard libraries (numpy, pandas, random, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, warnings), we used the following libraries: zipfile for extracting our data; scipy for csr_matrices, scikit-learn for model selection, label encoding, and evaluating cosine similarity; pyspark for Alternate Least Squares (ALS) modelling; and Surprise for our K-nearest Neighbors modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling:\n",
    "We initially implemented an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model using Spark for collaborative filtering. ALS decomposes the user-item matrix to uncover latent factors, optimized via hyperparameter tuning (rank, maxIter, and RegParam). We then introduced a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) baseline model using the Surprise package, tuning for optimal k and min_k values. This approach strategizes to combat 'cold-start' problems where users have little to no rating history, or when movies have little to no ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "Performance was assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), where a lower RMSE indicates better predictive accuracy. Grid search tuning found the best model to be KNN Baseline (k=56, min_k=14) with an RMSE of 0.886, slightly outperforming the ALS baseline (RMSE 0.888). ALS remains valuable for handling cold start issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights and Limitations:\n",
    "Additional user behavior tracking—such as viewing duration and repeated watches—could improve recommendations. Incorporating explicit user preferences, such as favorite genres and actors, would further refine personalization. Future iterations may explore hybrid deep learning models for enhanced performance."
